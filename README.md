# ObservaAI
Smart Observability and Health Monitoring with AI at Core

# ðŸ“š Microservices Observability with AI Insights

This project demonstrates a **microservices architecture** enhanced with:
- **Distributed Tracing** via Zipkin
- **Metrics Monitoring** via Prometheus
- **Service Discovery** via Eureka
- **API Gateway** for routing
- **Feign Client** for inter-service communication
- **Spring AI + ChatGPT** for **AI-driven application insights** based on real metrics and traces.
